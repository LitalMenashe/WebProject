                    MyTrip is a small startup, made of great personnel with passion for trips and adventures around the globe.<br/>
                    We believe that every person has unique qualities that define him/her, so their trips shouldn't be the same!<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made a free online trip planner that can help you build a personalized itinerary for your next vacation.<br/>
                    To plan with MyTrip, you tell it where you&apos;re going, your dates, and your sightseeing preferences. Within seconds, you'll receive a detailed list with trip routes, restaurants, attractions and more.<br/>
                    You can also create a custom activity on your calendar. You can name the restaurant you want to eat at for lunch, the hotel you want to sleep in, or another activity that you couldn't find in our database.<br/>
                    The software provides a complete set of tools and recommendations so you can research the destination and make any desired changes to the itinerary.<br/>
                    MyTrip's trip-planning features also include an easy and convenient system for building your equipment list. We will help you find a recommended equipment list for your needs, and you can also customize your own list.<br/>
                    If you have some important extra details you need to remember such as important phone numbers, transportation details, accommodation details, a link to another site with information about a custom activity, addresses, and much more, you can write everything down in your trip Notes.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have settled on the itinerary and made your bookings, you can take your plan with you on the trip, and see it from anywhere you want! If you want to ask friends for advice on the itinerary, you can do so.<br/>
                    MyTrip makes vacation planning fast, fun, and easy!
